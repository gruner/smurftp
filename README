# Smurftp
 
Smurftp creates a queue of recently modified files for quickly uploading to a remote server via FTP.
 
## Usage

Start Smurftp with this command:

    smurftp <directory or configuration file>

## Configuration

Smurftp requires a configuration file in YAML format that defines your FTP server and login information, as well as a local directory ('document_root').

When starting Smurftp, if you specify a directory, it looks for a 'smurftp_config.yaml' file in that directory. If the file is not found you'll be given the option for this file to be generated for you.

Alternatively, if you specify an existing configuration file (it doesn't require the 'smurftp_config.yaml' name) Smurftp will start by loading this file. Because the local 'document_root' is defined in the configuration file, you can store the configuration file separately from your project files if you choose.

## File List

Smurftp will search the defined 'document_root' directory and list all files in all sub directories, ordered by modification date, newest files first. It skips any files defined in the 'exclusions' list.

    [1] foo.php
    [2] images/bar.jpg
    [3] includes/header.php
    [4] images/logo.png
    [5] yada.php
    ====================
    smurftp>

At the `smurftp>` prompt enter the number identifier of the files you want uploaded. You can also enter a list or range of files.

    1 uploads file [1]
    1-5 uploads files [1-5]
    1,2,4 uploads [1], [2], and [4]
    1-5,^4 uploads files [1-3], and [5], skiping file [4]
    1-5,!4 same as above
    all uploads all listed files

To quit type `quit` or `exit` at the prompt. `e` or `q` will also quit.

## TODO

* be able to run multiple sources from the same config file (i.e. smurftp config.yaml site)
