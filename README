# Smurftp
 
Smurftp creates a queue of recently modified files for quickly uploading to a remote server via FTP.
 
 ## Usage

Start Smurftp with this command:

    smurftp <directory or configuration file>

If the specified directory contains a 'smurftp_config.yaml' file, you're good to go. Otherwise you'll be given the option for this file to be generated for you.

Alternately, you can run Smurftp from a configuration file that points to a different local directory.

## File List

Smurftp will search the specified directory and list all files in all sub directories, ordered by modification date, newest files first.

Type the number of the files you want uploaded. You can also enter a list or range of files.

    1 uploads file [1]
    1-5 uploads files 1-5
    1-5,^4 skips file 4 and files 1-3, and 5
    1,2,4 uploads 1, 2, and 4
    all uploads all listed files
